:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is available in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview).
Learn why you should use Nexus in the [evaluation guide](/evaluate/nexus).

:::

Nexus has integrated [execution debugging](/nexus/execution-debugging) in the UI and CLI.

### Pending Nexus Operations
Pending Nexus Operations are displayed in the caller Workflow details page, similar to pending Activities.

For example:

![Pending Operations](/img/nexus/pending-nexus-operations.png)

See [pending Operations](/nexus/execution-debugging#pending-operations) for more details.

### Pending Nexus Callbacks

Pending Nexus Callbacks show the delivery status for completion notifications back to the caller.

For example:
![Pending callbacks](/img/nexus/nexus-callback.png)

See [pending Nexus Callbacks](/nexus/execution-debugging#pending-callbacks) for more details.

### Bi-directional linking

Bi-directional linking across Namespaces enables navigation across the callers and handlers to walk the end-to-end execution.

For example:

![Bi-directional linking](/img/nexus/nexus-bi-directional-linking.png)

See [bi-directional linking](/nexus/execution-debugging#bi-directional-linking) for more details.

### Nexus Operation ID
For Nexus Operations backed by a Temporal Workflow, the underlying handler Workflow ID is returned as the Nexus Operation ID.
When an asynchronous Nexus Operation starts an underlying Workflow, the underlying Workfow ID is returned as the Nexus Operation ID.
This is is reflected in the Nexus Operation Started event in the callerâ€™s Workflow history.

See [Nexus Operation ID](/nexus/execution-debugging#nexus-operation-id) for more details.
