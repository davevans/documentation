:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is available in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview).
Learn why you should use Nexus in the [evaluation guide](/evaluate/nexus).

:::

Nexus has integrated [execution debugging](/nexus/execution-debugging) in the UI and CLI.

### Pending Nexus Operations
Pending Nexus Operations are displayed in the caller Workflow details page, similar to pending Activities.

For example:

![Pending Operations](/img/nexus/pending-nexus-operations.png)

See [Pending Operations](/nexus/execution-debugging#pending-operations) for more details.

### Pending Nexus Callbacks

Pending Nexus Callbacks show the delivery status for completion notifications back to the caller.

For example:
![Pending callbacks](/img/nexus/nexus-callback.png)

See [Pending Callbacks](/nexus/execution-debugging#pending-callbacks) for more details.

### Bi-directional linking

Bi-directional linking across Namespaces enables navigation across the callers and handlers to walk the end-to-end execution.

For example:

![Bi-directional linking](/img/nexus/nexus-bi-directional-linking.png)

See [Bi-directional Linking](/nexus/execution-debugging#bi-directional-linking) for more details.

### Nexus Operation ID
For Nexus Operations backed by a Temporal Workflow, the underlying handler Workflow ID is returned as the Nexus Operation ID.
The callerâ€™s Workflow history shows the Nexus Operation ID in the [NexusOperationStarted](/references/events#nexusoperationstarted) event.

See [Nexus Operation ID](/nexus/execution-debugging#nexus-operation-id) for more details.
