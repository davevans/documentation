Nexus provides Cloud Metrics and Audit Log streaming, in addition to integrated [execution debugging](/production-deployment/cloud/nexus/execution-debugging).

## Metrics

Scheduling and processing a Nexus Operation is reported through existing cloud metrics with the following operation metric labels:

- Caller Namespace
  - RespondWorkflowTaskCompleted: This is used to schedule the Nexus Operation.
- Handler Namespace
  - PollNexusTaskQueue
  - RespondNexusTaskCompleted
  - RespondNexusTaskFailed

See [Cloud Metrics](/production-deployment/cloud/metrics/reference) for additional details.

## Audit Logging

The following Nexus control plane actions are sent to the Audit Logging integration:

- Create Nexus Endpoint: `CreateNexusEndpoint`
- Update Nexus Endpoint: `UpdateNexusEndpoint`
- Delete Nexus Endpoint: `DeleteNexusEndpoint`

See [Audit Logging](/cloud/audit-logging) for additional details.
