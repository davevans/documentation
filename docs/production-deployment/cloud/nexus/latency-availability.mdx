Nexus has the same [latency SLOs](/cloud/service-availability#latency) and [availability SLAs](/cloud/sla) for Nexus requests (commands, polling, responses) between Workers and Temporal Cloud.
These Worker-to-Namespace gRPC interactions include atomic handoff from the Worker to the built-in [Nexus Machinery](/glossary#nexus-machinery). 

![NexusYourCloud](/img/nexus/nexus-connect-queue-based-workers.png)

The Nexus Machinery deals with Nexus connectivity across Namespace boundaries using Temporal Cloud's global mTLS secured Envoy mesh and enforces Endpoint access controls.
The cross-namespace latency between the caller's Nexus Machinery and the handler's Nexus Machinery varies based on the locality of the caller and handler Namespaces.

Communication between Namespaces in the same region will have lower latency. 
Communication across different regions will have higher latency.
Consult the cross-region latency tables for your cloud provider(s) to estimate the latency for Nexus communication across Namespaces in Temporal Cloud.

See [Latency Service Level Objective (SLO)](/cloud/service-availability#latency), [Availability](/cloud/service-availability) and [SLA](/cloud/sla) for additional details.
