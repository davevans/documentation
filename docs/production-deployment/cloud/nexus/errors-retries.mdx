## Errors in Nexus Handlers

In Temporal, a user-defined Nexus handler is primarily responsible for starting a Nexus Operation.
Nexus handlers run in a Temporal Worker and use Temporal SDK builder functions like New-Sync-Operation or New-Workflow-Run-Operation to start an Operation.

Nexus handlers may return [different error types](/references/failures#nexus-errors).
If a Workflow is started by a Nexus handler, the Workflow result is propagated as the Nexus Operation result.
Nexus Operations can end up in [completed](/references/events#nexusoperationcompleted), [failed](/references/events#nexusoperationfailed), [canceled](/references/events#nexusoperationcanceled), and [timed out](/references/events#nexusoperationtimedout) states.

See [errors in Nexus handlers](/nexus/errors-retries) and the [error reference](/references/failures#errors-in-nexus-operations) for more information.

## Automatic Retries

All retryable errors are automatically retried by the Nexus Machinery.

:::tip

To avoid infinite retries and improve semantics, custom Nexus handlers should return a [specific Nexus error type](/references/failures#nexus-errors).

See [Nexus Automatic Retries](/nexus/errors-retries#automatic-retries) for additional details.

## Nexus Error Handling in Caller Workflows

A Nexus Operation Failure is delivered to the caller's Workflow Execution when a Nexus Operation fails.

See [error handling in caller Workflows](/nexus/errors-retries#nexus-error-handling-in-caller-workflows) for additional details.
