## Using Nexus in Temporal Cloud
[Temporal Nexus](/evaluate/nexus) allows you to reliably connect Temporal Applications.
It was designed with Durable Execution in mind and enables each team to have their own Namespace for improved modularity, security, debugging, and fault isolation.

[Nexus Services](/nexus/services) are exposed from a Nexus Endpoint created in the the [Nexus Registry](/nexus/registry).
A [Nexus Endpoint](/nexus/endpoints) is a reverse proxy that decouples the caller from the handler, routes requests to upstream targets, and enforces access controls.
Nexus Services and [Nexus Operations](/nexus/operations) are often registered in the same Worker as the underlying Temporal primitives they abstract.

When a caller Workflow executes a Nexus Operation, a Nexus request is sent to a Nexus Endpoint using the Endpoint name.
The Endpoint then routes the Nexus request to an upstream target Namespace and Task Queue that is being polled by a Nexus Worker.

## Build and use Nexus Services

Nexus has a familiar programming model to build and use Nexus Services using the Temporal SDK.
The [Nexus Operation lifecycle](/nexus/operations#operation-lifecycle) supports both synchronous and asynchronous Operations.
Nexus Operations can be implemented with Temporal primitives, like Workflows, or execute arbitrary code.

## Queue-based Worker architecture

Nexus uses the Temporal queue-based Worker architecture to ensure reliable execution and automatic load balancing for Nexus Operations.
When a caller Workflow schedules a Nexus Operation, Temporal atomically transfers the Nexus request to a Nexus state machine responsible for [at-least-once](#at-least-once) invocation of the Nexus Operation.

In Temporal Cloud, Nexus connectivity across Namespaces is provided with a combination of robust Nexus Machinery and Temporal Cloud's global mTLS-secured Envoy mesh.
Built-in Endpoint access controls can be configured in the Nexus Registry to limit which caller namespaces can use an Endpoint.

Workers authenticate to thier Namespace with an mTLS client certificate or API Key.
This establishes the caller's identity and caller namespace for Endpoint access control.
Nexus handler Workers poll the Endpoint's target Task Queue for Nexus Tasks to process.

![NexusYourCloud](/img/nexus/nexus-workers-short.png)

For example, when you execute a synchronous Nexus Operation from a caller Workflow, the Workers communicate with their Namespace gRPC endpoint:
1. The caller Worker executes a Nexus Operation by responding with a [ScheduleNexusOperation](/references/commands#schedulenexusoperation) command.
2. The handler Worker gets a [Nexus Task](/workers#nexus-task) to start a Nexus Operation, by polling the Nexus Endpoint's target Task Queue.
3. The handler Worker processes the Task and responds with the result.
4. The result is recorded in the caller's Workflow history as a Nexus Operation event.
5. The caller Worker recieves the result of the [ScheduleNexusOperation](/references/commands#schedulenexusoperation) command, by polling it's Workflow Task Queue.

:::info

Temporal Cloud supports Nexus connectivity within and across cloud regions. Cross-cloud connectivity is not yet supported.

## Execution Semantics

### At-least-once Execution Semantics {#at-least-once}

Nexus Operations, like Activities, have at-least-once execution semantics.
The caller's Nexus Machinery will keep trying to start the Operation multiple times.

### Exactly-once Execution Semantics {#exactly-once}

To dedupe work and get exactly-once execution semantics, an Operation can start a Workflow with a WorkflowIdReusePolicy of RejectDuplicates which only allows one Workflow Execution per Workflow ID within a Namespace for the retention period.

### Idempotency

Nexus Operation handlers should be idempotent just like Activities should be idempotent as a general rule.
It's not required in all cases, but highly recommended in general.

## Multi-level Nexus calls
Nexus supports multi-level Nexus calls, for example:
- Workflow A → Nexus Operation 1 → Workflow B → Nexus Operation 2 → Workflow C
