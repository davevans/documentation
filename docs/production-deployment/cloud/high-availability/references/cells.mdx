:::tip HIGH AVAILABILITY FOR ALL CUSTOMERS

This page discusses the High Availability Namespace architecture offered to all Temporal Cloud customers.
To read about High Availability features for mission-critical use-cases, please visit the [Namespaces with High Availability features](/cloud/high-availability#high-availability-features) section of our documentation after you're done with this page.

Temporal Cloud deployment provides 99.99% availability and a contractual service level agreement (SLA) of 99.9% guarantee against service errors.
To keep systems reliable, Temporal separates workloads into independent task management units.
This limits the impact of failures and helps our services stay available for when you need them most.
This page explains this design, and how it protects uptime and handles growth.

## Availability Zones and Isolation Domains

Each standard Temporal Namespace replicates its data across three **availability zones**.
An availability zone (AZ) is a cloud provider's physical or logical data center or cluster of resources that is isolated from other zones.
Availability zones increase resilience by physically and logically separating infrastructure within a region.

Each AZ operates independently, reducing the risk of failure affecting the entire system.
They are often located in separate geographical locations.
Temporal uses the term **isolation domain** to refer to zones.
These are geographically or physically isolated from each other.

Workloads distributed across multiple availability zones can continue running when one zone experiences an outage.

## Regions

A region is a geographically defined area that contains multiple availability zones or data centers.
It's typically a self-contained unit of a cloud providerâ€™s infrastructure that helps provide redundancy, low-latency access, and fault tolerance.

Temporal operates in multiple regions for high availability and fault tolerance.
The [Multi-region Namespace](/cloud/high-availability#replications-and-replicas) feature allows Temporal to replicate data and services across different regions.
This ensures mission-critical resilience even when an entire region becomes unavailable, whether through a network outage or a natural disaster.

## Temporal Cells

Temporal Cloud's **cells** are a fundamental architectural concept.
Each cell is an infrastructure unit that can independently manage tasks, resources, or workloads.
They're designed for isolation, fault tolerance, and efficient resource allocation in the Temporal platform.

Every Temporal Cloud Namespace replicates its data and operations across three availability zones (isolation domains).
This design helps manage workloads and ensures tasks are completed.
This approach improves resource use and reduces delays and latency.

During data replication, any changes to Workflow state or History are saved in all three zones before the Temporal Service acknowledges a change back to the Client.
As a result, your standard Temporal Namespace stays operational even if one of its three zones becomes unavailable.
This architecture forms the basis of our base 99.9% service level.

## Cell Architecture and Composition

Our cell architecture is managed by Temporal's Control Plane.
We needed a Control Plane that would manage provisioning  resources, deploying software, and handle Cell configuration changes.
Our Control plane monitors, alerts, and handles certain failure classes.

Each cell in Temporal Cloud uses:

- Several compute clusters
- One or more databases
- Elastic Search
- Ingress components
- Observability stack
- Additional dependency components

We used Temporal itself to building the Control Plane.
Temporal is an excellent fit for automating infrastructure management.
That's because operations on cloud resources can take time, sometimes a fairly long time.
A dependency service might return various retriable and non-retriable errors, and retries usually require backoff timing.
Temporal treats our Control Plane operations like any other Workflow.
Each Workflow retains a complete history of its execution, with all inputs and outputs, timestamps, and errors.

### Managing our Cells

Temporal uses entity Workflows to manage cells.
Each cell has a dedicated entity Workflow that manages its entire lifecycle, from provisioning to upgrades.
This approach ensures consistency and simplifies concurrency control.

:::info Entity Workflows

Unlike process Workflows, an entity Workflow is long-lived.
It represents a single resource that manages a resource or process throughout its life.
Entity Workflows often are used to manage individual customers, subscriptions, or long-term processes like cell management.

### Choosing the Cell Architecture

We use the cell architecture to:

- **Minimize blast radius**:
  Dividing infrastructure into cells means Temporal contains the impact of any issues.
  If there are ten cells in a region and one experiences a problem, only about 10% of customers in that region would be affected.
  This might happen due to software edge cases, infrastructure incidents, or operator mistakes.
- **Enable scaling**:
  Temporal clusters scale with the database and compute resources allocated to them.
  Our cell architecture supports both scaling out (by adding more cells) and scaling up (by using larger cells).
  Larger cells handle higher throughput for individual Namespaces and absorb traffic spikes when they occur.
  Running large cells helps customers that need high throughput for a single Namespace.

In summary, Temporal Cloud cells are a critical architectural component that provide isolation, fault tolerance, and scalability.
Every Temporal Cloud Namespace is backed by three cells to guarantee high availability and responsiveness.
