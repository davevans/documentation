Start building your Temporal application by defining the key components: Workflows, Activities, and Workers.

Each of these plays a distinct role:

- A **Workflow** defines your application's control flow and business logic.
- An **Activity** performs the actual workâ€”such as calling APIs or accessing databases.
- A **Worker** runs the code and connects your app to the Temporal Service.

In this section, you:

- Define a [Workflow](/build-with-temporal/go/applications/define-workflow)
- Define one or more [Activities](/build-with-temporal/go/applications/define-activity)
- [Run a Worker](/build-with-temporal/go/applications/run-worker) to execute them

Once you have these pieces in place, you can start creating Workflow Executions, pass data, handle errors, and scale up.
