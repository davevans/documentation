A Worker runs your application code.
It listens for Tasks on a Task Queue and executes your registered Workflows and Activities.

## Create a Worker

Start by creating a Temporal Client, then create a Worker and register your Workflows and Activities.

```go
package main

import (
    "log"

    "go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
    "go.temporal.io/sdk/worker"
    "yourapp"
)

func main() {
    // Connect to Temporal
    c, err := client.Dial(client.Options{})
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalln("Unable to create Temporal client", err)
    }
    defer c.Close()

    // Create a Worker for a specific Task Queue
    w := worker.New(c, "your-task-queue", worker.Options{})

    // Register your Workflow(s)
    w.RegisterWorkflow(yourapp.MyWorkflow)

    // Register your Activity(ies)
    w.RegisterActivity(yourapp.MyActivity)

    // Start the Worker
    err = w.Run(worker.InterruptCh())
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalln("Unable to start Worker", err)
    }
}
```

## Register multiple Workflows or Activities

Each Worker can register as many Workflows and Activities as you need, as long as each one has a unique name.

```go
w.RegisterWorkflow(MyWorkflowA)
w.RegisterWorkflow(MyWorkflowB)

w.RegisterActivity(MyActivityA)
w.RegisterActivity(MyActivityB)
```

If you're using struct-based Activities, register the struct instead:

```go
inventory := &InventoryService{DBClient: db}
w.RegisterActivity(inventory)
```

## Run with automatic reload (optional)

To improve your development loop, you can use [`gow`](https://github.com/mitranim/gow) to auto-reload your Worker process when files change.

```bash
go install github.com/mitranim/gow@latest
gow run main.go
```

---

With a running Worker, your Temporal application is ready to execute Workflows and Activities.
You can now start a Workflow Execution using your application code or the CLI.
