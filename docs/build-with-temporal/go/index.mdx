This section helps you build reliable and scalable applications using Temporal, Durable Execution, and the Go SDK.
Use it to design, implement, test, and scale your Workflows—starting from the basics and progressing into advanced patterns.

<!--
- Create your [core application structure](/build-with-temporal/go/core-application)
- [Run code in a Workflow](/build-with-temporal/go/workflows)
- [Handle process disruptions](/build-with-temporal/go/error-handling) by implementing Retry Policies and error handling.
- [Interact with running Workflow executions](/build-with-temporal/go/message-passing) to check status and send updates.
- [Test your application](/build-with-temporal/go/testing) so it's strong before you deploy.
- [Level up your application] by adding observability, versioning, and advanced behaviors.
