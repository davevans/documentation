This page shows how to do the following:

- [Workflow timeouts](#workflow-timeouts)
- [Workflow retries](#workflow-retries)
- [Activity timeouts](#activity-timeouts)
- [Activity Retry Policy](#activity-retries)
- [Heartbeat an Activity](#activity-heartbeats)
- [Heartbeat Timeout](#heartbeat-timeout)

## Workflow timeouts {#workflow-timeouts}

Each Workflow timeout controls the maximum duration of a different aspect of a Workflow Execution.

- **[Workflow Execution Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-execution-timeout)**: Limits how long the full Workflow Execution can run.
- **[Workflow Run Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-run-timeout)**: Limits the duration of an individual run of a Workflow Execution.
- **[Workflow Task Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-workflow-failures#workflow-task-timeout)**: Limits the time allowed for a Worker to process a Workflow Task.

Set these values in the `WorkflowOptions` when starting a Workflow.

### Workflow retries {#workflow-retries}

Use a [Retry Policy](/encyclopedia/retry-policies) to automatically retry Workflow Executions on failure.
Workflow Executions do not retry by default.

<!-- CONTENT -->

## Activity timeouts {#activity-timeouts}

Each Activity Timeout controls a different aspect of how long an Activity Execution can take:

- **[Schedule-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-close-timeout)**
- **[Start-To-Close Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#start-to-close-timeout)**
- **[Schedule-To-Start Timeout](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#schedule-to-start-timeout)**

At least one of `StartToCloseTimeout` or `ScheduleToCloseTimeout` is required.

<!-- CONTENT -->

### Activity Retry Policy {#activity-retries}

By default, Activities use a system Retry Policy.
You can override it by specifying a custom Retry Policy.

<!-- CONTENT -->

### Override the retry interval with `nextRetryDelay` {#next-retry-delay}

If you raise an application-level error, you can override the Retry Policy's delay by specifying a new delay.

<!-- CONTENT -->

## Heartbeat an Activity {#activity-heartbeats}

A Heartbeat is a periodic signal from the Worker to the Temporal Service indicating the Activity is still alive and making progress.

- Heartbeats are used to detect Worker failure.
- Cancellations are delivered via Heartbeats.
- Heartbeats may contain custom progress details.

<!-- CONTENT -->

### Heartbeat Timeout {#heartbeat-timeout}

The Heartbeat Timeout sets the maximum duration between Heartbeats before the Temporal Service considers the Activity failed.
