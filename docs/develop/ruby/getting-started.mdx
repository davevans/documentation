# Quick Start – Ruby SDK
This guide walks you through setting up the Temporal Ruby SDK and running your first Workflow. 
In just a few steps, you'll install the SDK, start a local development server, and see a Workflow in action.

## 1. Installation

Install the Temporal SDK using your preferred method.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="gemfile" label="Gemfile">

  ```ruby
  gem 'temporalio'
  ```

This approach is used in Ruby projects that manage dependencies with Bundler. 

To install it, add the line to your project's Gemfile and run `bundle install` in your terminal. 
Bundler will download and install the gem and its dependencies. 

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="Command Line (gem install)">

  ```bash
  gem install temporalio
  ```

This approach installs the Temporal SDK gem directly via the command line. 
It installs the gem and its dependencies system-wide or in your current Ruby environment. 
The gem becomes available for any Ruby script you run. 

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Both methods will install the same Temporal SDK, which supports Ruby versions 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4. 

> **Note:**  
> - Only macOS ARM/x64 and Linux ARM/x64 are supported.  
> - Source gem is published but **cannot be built directly**.  
> - Windows (MinGW) is not supported.  
> - `fibers`/`async` are only supported on Ruby **3.3+**.  
> - See [Platform Support](#) for full details.


## 2. Start the Temporal Server Locally

With the SDK installed, you’ll need a local Temporal Server to run your Workflows. 
The easiest way to do this is with [**Temporal CLI**](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/cli/).

<Tabs groupId="os" queryString>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

You can install the latest version with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) using the following command:

```command
brew install temporal
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

To install Temporal CLI on Windows, download the version for your architecture:

- [Download Temporal CLI for Windows amd64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=windows&arch=amd64)
- [Download Temporal CLI for Windows arm64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=windows&arch=arm64)

Once you've downloaded the file, extract the downloaded archive and add the `temporal.exe` binary to your `PATH`.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">


To install Temporal CLI, download the version for your architecture:

- [Download Temporal CLI for Linux amd64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=linux&arch=amd64)
- [Download Temporal CLI for Linux arm64](https://temporal.download/cli/archive/latest?platform=linux&arch=arm64)

Once you've downloaded the file, extract the downloaded archive and add the `temporal` binary to your `PATH` by copying it to a directory like `/usr/local/bin`.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once installed, run the development server by opening up a new terminal window:

```bash
temporal server start-dev
```

This will:
- Start a Temporal Service on `localhost:7233`
- Launch the Web UI on [http://localhost:8233](http://localhost:8233)
- Create the default namespace
- Use an in-memory database (data is lost when you stop the server)

Leave this running in a separate terminal tab or window while you develop.

> **Optional:** To retain data between runs, use:
>
> ```bash
> temporal server start-dev --db-filename my_temporal.db
> ```


## 3. Write Your First Activity and Workflow 

Now let’s define the building blocks of a Temporal Application: an Activity and a Workflow.

Open your IDE or code editor of choice and create a file named `say_hello_activity`. 
Next, create another file in the same directory named `say_hello_workflow.rb`.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="activity" label="Activity (say_hello_activity.rb)">

  ```ruby
  require 'temporalio/activity'

  class SayHelloActivity < Temporalio::Activity::Definition
    def execute(name)
      "Hello, #{name}!"
    end
  end
  ```
The `Temporalio::Activity::Definition` signals to the Temporal SDK that this is an Activity. 
In this file, you define a class called `SayHelloActivity`. 
Inside the class, you implement an execute method which takes one argument (name) and returns a personalized greeting.

Activities perform single, well-defined tasks (like formatting a greeting). 
They can interact with external systems, APIs, and databases. 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="workflow" label="Workflow (say_hello_workflow.rb)">

  ```ruby
  require 'temporalio/workflow'
  require_relative 'say_hello_activity'

  class SayHelloWorkflow < Temporalio::Workflow::Definition
    def execute(name)
      Temporalio::Workflow.execute_activity(
        SayHelloActivity,
        name,
        schedule_to_close_timeout: 300
      )
    end
  end
  ```


A Workflow defines the overall flow of the application.
The `Temporalio::Workflow::Definition` signals to the Temporal SDK that this is a Workflow Definition.
In this example, you define a `SayHelloWorkflow` class. 
It uses `execute_activity` to run the `SayHelloActivity`, passing along the name as input. 
It also sets a timeout of 300 seconds, which tells Temporal how long it should wait for the Activity to finish.


  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## 4. Run a Worker

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="worker" label="Worker (worker.rb)">

  ```ruby
  require 'temporalio/client'
  require 'temporalio/worker'
  require_relative 'say_hello_activity'
  require_relative 'say_hello_workflow'

  client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233', 'my-namespace')

  worker = Temporalio::Worker.new(
    client:,
    task_queue: 'my-task-queue',
    workflows: [SayHelloWorkflow],
    activities: [SayHelloActivity]
  )

  worker.run(shutdown_signals: ['SIGINT'])
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Workers, which are part of your application and provided by the Temporal SDK, then carry out the tasks defined in your Workflow.
For more information on Workers, see [Understanding Temporal](/evaluate/understanding-temporal#workers) and a [deep dive into Workers](/workers). 

## 5. Execute a Workflow and See the Result

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="execute" label="Execute Workflow (execute_workflow.rb)">

  ```ruby
  require 'temporalio/client'
  require_relative 'say_hello_workflow'

  client = Temporalio::Client.connect('localhost:7233', 'my-namespace')

  result = client.execute_workflow(
    SayHelloWorkflow,
    'Temporal',
    id: 'my-workflow-id',
    task_queue: 'my-task-queue'
  )

  puts "Result: #{result}"
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

**Expected output:**
```
Result: Hello, Temporal!
```
