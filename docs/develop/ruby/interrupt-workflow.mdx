This page shows how to interrupt a Workflow Execution.

You can interrupt a Workflow Execution in one of the following ways:

- [Cancel](#cancellation): Canceling a Workflow provides a graceful way to stop Workflow Execution.
- [Terminate](#termination): Terminating a Workflow forcefully stops Workflow Execution.

Terminating a Workflow forcefully stops Workflow Execution.
This action resembles killing a process.

- The system records a `WorkflowExecutionTerminated` event in the Workflow History.
- The termination forcefully and immediately stops the Workflow Execution.
- The Workflow code gets no chance to handle termination.
- A Workflow Task doesn't get scheduled.

In most cases, canceling is preferable because it allows the Workflow to finish gracefully.
Terminate only if the Workflow is stuck and cannot be canceled normally.

## Cancellation {#cancellation}

To give a Workflow and its Activities the ability to be cancelled, do the following:

- Handle a Cancellation request within a Workflow.
- Set Activity Heartbeat Timeouts.
- Listen for and handle a Cancellation request within an Activity.
- Send a Cancellation request from a Temporal Client.
