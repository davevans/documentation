This page covers capabilities related to viewing the state of the application, including:

- [Metrics](#metrics)
- [Tracing](#tracing)
- [Logging](#logging)
- [Visibility](#visibility)

The observability guide covers the many ways to view the current state of your [Temporal Application](/temporal#temporal-application).
This includes viewing [Workflow Executions](/workflow-execution) tracked by the [Temporal Platform](/temporal#temporal-platform), as well as inspecting state at any point during execution.

## Emit metrics {#metrics}

Each Temporal SDK can optionally emit metrics from either the Client or Worker process.

- Metrics can be scraped by systems like [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/).
- Graphs can be created using tools like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/).
- For a list of metrics, see the [SDK metrics reference](/references/sdk-metrics).

## Setup Tracing {#tracing}

Tracing enables observability into the sequence of calls across your application, including Workflows and Activities.

## Log from a Workflow {#logging}

Logging enables you to capture and persist important execution details from your Workflow and Activity code.

Logging levels typically include:

| Level   | Use                                                                                                       |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TRACE` | The most detailed level of logging, used for very fine-grained information.                               |
| `DEBUG` | Detailed information, typically useful for debugging purposes.                                            |
| `INFO`  | General information about the application's operation.                                                    |
| `WARN`  | Indicates potentially harmful situations or minor issues that don't prevent the application from working. |
| `ERROR` | Indicates error conditions that might still allow the application to continue running.                    |

## Use Visibility APIs {#visibility}

Visibility refers to Temporal features for listing, filtering, and inspecting Workflow Executions.

### Use Search Attributes {#search-attributes}

- [Default Search Attributes](/search-attribute#default-search-attribute) like `WorkflowType`, `StartTime`, and `ExecutionStatus` are automatically indexed.
- [Custom Search Attributes](/search-attribute#custom-search-attribute) let you store domain-specific metadata for Workflows.
