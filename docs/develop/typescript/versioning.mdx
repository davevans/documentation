Since Workflow Executions in Temporal can run for long periods — sometimes months or even years — it's common to need to make changes to a Workflow Definition, even while a particular Workflow Execution is in progress.

The Temporal Platform requires that Workflow code is [deterministic](/workflow-definition#deterministic-constraints).
If you make a change to your Workflow code that would cause non-deterministic behavior on Replay, you'll need to use one of our Versioning methods to gracefully update your running Workflows.
With Versioning, you can modify your Workflow Definition so that new executions use the updated code, while existing ones continue running the original version.
There are three primary Versioning methods supported by Temporal:

- [Workflow Type Versioning](#type-versioning). This is the simplest of the three, and acts more like a cutover than true versioning. It is suitable for short-running Workflows.
- [Versioning with Patching](#patching). This method works by adding branches to your code tied to specific revisions. It can be used to revise in-progress Workflows.
- [Safe Deploys](/production-deployment/worker-deployments/safe-deploys). Temporal's Safe Deploys feature allows you to tag your Workers and programmatically roll them out in pods tied to specific revisions, so that old Workers can run old code paths and new Workers can run new code paths. A previous version of Safe Deploys was called [Worker Versioning](worker-versioning-legacy).

## Workflow Type Versioning {#type-versioning}

Since incompatible changes only affect open Workflow Executions of the same type, you can avoid the problem by changing the Workflow Type for the new version.
To do this, you can copy the Workflow Definition function, giving it a different name, and make sure that both names were registered with your Workers.

For example, if you had made an incompatible change to the following Workflow Definition:

```typescript
function pizzaWorkflow(order: PizzaOrder): Promise<OrderConfirmation> {
  // implementation code omitted for this example
}
```

then you would change the code as follows:

```typescript
function pizzaWorkflow(order: PizzaOrder): Promise<OrderConfirmation> {
  // this function contains the original code
}

function pizzaWorkflowV2(order: PizzaOrder): Promise<OrderConfirmation> {
  // this function contains the updated code
}
```

You can use any name you like for the new function.
Using some type of version identifier, such as V2 in this example, will make it easier to identify the change.

You would then update the Worker configuration to register both Workflow Types:

```typescript
const worker = await Worker.create({
  workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
  // other configurations
});
```

The upside of this versioning method is that it is easy to understand at a glance, as it does not really use any Temporal platform features.
The downside of this method is that it does not use any Temporal platform features.
It requires you to duplicate code and to update any code and commands used to start the Workflow.
This can become impractical over time, depending on how you are providing configuration strings to your deployment.
This method also does not provide a way to introduce versioning to any still-running Workflows -- it is essentially just a cutover, unlike the Patching method.

## Versioning with Patching {#patching}

Patching essentially defines a logical branch for a specific change in the Workflow, rather than for the entire Workflow Definition itself.

Suppose you have an initial Workflow that runs `activityA`:

```ts
// v1
export async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {
  await activityA();
  await sleep('1 days'); // arbitrary long sleep to simulate a long running workflow we need to patch
  await activityThatMustRunAfterA();
}
```

Now, you want to update your code to run `activityB` instead. This represents your desired end state.

```ts
// vFinal
export async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {
  await activityB();
  await sleep('1 days');
}
```

The problem is that you cannot deploy this `vFinal` revision directly until you're certain there are no more running Workflows created using the `v1` code, otherwise you are likely to cause a nondeterminism error.
Instead, you'll need to use the [`patched`](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#patched) function to check which version of the code should be executed.

Patching is a three-step process:

1. Patch in any new, updated code using the `patched()` function. Run the new patched code alongside old code.
2. Remove old code and use `deprecatePatch()` to mark a particular patch as deprecated.
3. Once there are no longer any open Worklow Executions of the previous version of the code, remove `deprecatePatch()`.
   Let's walk through this process in sequence.

### Patching in new code

Using `patched` inserts a marker into the Workflow History.
During Replay, if a Worker encounters a history with that marker, it will fail the Workflow task when the Workflow code doesn't produce the same patch marker (in this case `your-change-id`).
This ensures you can safely deploy code from `v2` as a "feature flag" alongside the original version (`v1`).

```ts
// v2
import { patched } from '@temporalio/workflow';
export async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {
  if (patched('my-change-id')) {
    await activityB();
    await sleep('1 days');
  } else {
    await activityA();
    await sleep('1 days');
    await activityThatMustRunAfterA();
  }
}
```

### Deprecating patches {#deprecated-patches}

After ensuring that all Workflows started with `v1` code have finished, you can [deprecate the patch](https://typescript.temporal.io/api/namespaces/workflow#deprecatepatch).

Once you're confident that your Workflows are no longer running the pre-patch code paths, you can deploy your code with `deprecatePatch()`.
These Workers will be running the most up-to-date version of the Workflow code, which no longer requires the patch.
The `deprecatePatch()` function works similarly to the `patched()` function by recording a marker in the Workflow history.
This marker does not fail replay when Workflow code does not emit it.
Deprecated patches serve as a bridge between the pre-patch code paths and the post-patch code paths, and are useful for avoiding errors resulting from patched code paths in your Workflow history.

```ts
// v3
import { deprecatePatch } from '@temporalio/workflow';

export async function myWorkflow(): Promise<void> {
  deprecatePatch('my-change-id');
  await activityB();
  await sleep('1 days');
}
```

### Removing a patch {#deploy-new-code}

Once you're sure that you will no longer need to [Query](/develop/typescript/message-passing#send-query) or Replay any of your pre-patch Workflows, you can then safely deploy Workers that no longer use either the `patched()` or `deprecatePatch()` calls:

Patching allows you to make changes to currently running Workflows.
It is a powerful method for introducing compatible changes without introducing non-determinism errors.

## Safe Deploys

Temporal's [Safe Deploys](/production-deployment/worker-deployments/safe-deploys) feature allows you to tag your Workers and programmatically roll them out in pods tied to specific revisions, so that old Workers can run old code paths and new Workers can run new code paths. If you find that patching is adding maintainability concerns to your codebase, consider adopting [Safe Deploys](/production-deployment/worker-deployments/safe-deploys).

Changing the order of any commands in your Workflow code that interact directly with the Temporal Service -- such as calling an Activity or creating a Sleep timer -- will cause a non-determinism error unless you've implemented a versioning solution.
To test whether a new revision will require versioning, you should incorporate [Replay Testing](/develop/typescript/testing-suite#replay).
