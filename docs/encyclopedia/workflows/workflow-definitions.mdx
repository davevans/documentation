:::tip Support, stability, and dependency info

Our Docs modernization effort is underway.
New documentation will co-exist alongside our current docs content.
We're rebuilding the docs for better organization and engagement so you can find what you need to know with clear unambiguous communication.

A Workflow Definition is code that defines how a Workflow functions.
You write your definitions in your preferred programming languages using Temporal's suite of SDKs.
A Workflow Definition (sometimes referred to as a Workflow Function) encompasses the end-to-end series of steps of a Temporal application.
It has one entry point and takes a custom payload as input.
Depending on the programming language, the Workflow Definition is typically a function or object method.

## Supported development languages

Below are different ways to develop a basic Workflow Definition using our existing SDKs.
Although it's possible to use an unsupported language to develop a Temporal application we advise against it.
It's much harder and you'll have fewer resources to call on in our community.

:::info Terminology Trivia

In practice, a Workflow Definition and a Workflow Function are basically the same thing.
If you dive deeper, you'll uncover the nuanced distinctions between the two:

- A Workflow Definition refers to the code source managed by a Workflow Execution.
  A Workflow Execution is a complete process, which runs from start to completion.
  The Workflow Definition runs once per execution.
- A Workflow Function refers to the source for the instance of a Workflow _Function_ Execution.
  Temporal may invoke a Workflow Function Execution more than once during the lifetime of a Workflow Execution, normally during replays.
