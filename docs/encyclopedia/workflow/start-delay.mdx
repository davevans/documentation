:::

Start Delay determines the amount of time to wait before initiating a Workflow Execution.

:::note

Start Delay Workflow Execution is incompatible with both [Schedules](#schedule) and [Cron Jobs](#temporal-cron-job).

:::

This is useful if you have a Workflow you want to schedule out in the future, but only want it to execute once: in comparison to reoccurring Workflows using Schedules.

If the Workflow receives a Signal-With-Start during the delay, it dispatches a Workflow Task and the remaining delay is bypassed.
If the Workflow receives a Signal during the delay that is not a Signal-With-Start, the Signal does not interrupt the delay, and the Workflow continues to be delayed until the delay expires or a Signal-With-Start is received.

You can delay the dispatch of the initial Workflow Execution by setting this option in the Workflow Options field of the SDK of your choice.

## What is a State Transition? {#state-transition}

A State Transition is a unit of progress made by a [Workflow Execution](#workflow-execution).
Each State Transition is recorded in a persistence store.

Some operations, such as [Activity Heartbeats](/encyclopedia/detecting-activity-failures#activity-heartbeat), require only one or two State Transitions each. With an Activity Heartbeat, there are two: the Activity Heartbeat and a Timer.

Most operations require multiple State Transitions.

For example, a simple Workflow with two sequential [Activity Tasks](/workers#activity-task) (and no retries) produces 11 State Transitions: two for Workflow start, four for each Activity, and one for Workflow completion.
