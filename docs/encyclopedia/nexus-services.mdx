## A named collection of Nexus Operations

A Nexus Service is a named collection of arbitrary-duration Nexus Operations that provide a microservice contract suitable for sharing across team boundaries.
Nexus Services are registered with a Temporal Worker that is polling the target Namespace and Task Queue for a Nexus Endpoint.

For example, a Nexus Service is often registered in the same Worker as the underlying Workflows they abstract:

```go
func main() {
	c, err := client.Dial(client.Options{})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("Unable to create client", err)
	}
	defer c.Close()

	w := worker.New(c, taskQueue, worker.Options{})
	service := nexus.NewService(service.HelloServiceName)
	err = service.Register(handler.EchoOperation, handler.HelloOperation)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("Unable to register operations", err)
	}
	w.RegisterNexusService(service)
	w.RegisterWorkflow(handler.HelloHandlerWorkflow)

	err = w.Run(worker.InterruptCh())
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("Unable to start worker", err)
	}
}
```

The Nexus Service name is used when invoking a Nexus Operation from a caller workflow.
