:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is available in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

[Temporal Nexus](/evaluate/nexus) is a feature of the Temporal Platform designed to connect durable executions across team, Namespace, region, and cloud boundaries.
It promotes a more modular architecture for sharing a subset of your team’s capabilities via well-defined microservice contracts for other teams to use, that abstract underlying Temporal primitives, like Workflows, or execute arbitrary code.

Nexus provides an integrated Temporal SDK experience, built-in Nexus Machinery, and first-class observability. It enables each team to have their own Namespace for improved security, troubleshooting, and blast radius isolation.

## Integrated Temporal experience

[Nexus Services](/nexus/services-operations) are exposed from [Nexus Endpoints](/nexus/registry-endpoints#nexus-endpoints) that are created in the [Nexus Registry](/nexus/registry-endpoints#nexus-registry).
A [Nexus Endpoint](/nexus/registry-endpoints#nexus-endpoints) is a reverse proxy that can serve multiple [Nexus Services](/nexus/services-operations).
It decouples the caller from the handler and routes Nexus requests to an upstream target Namespace and Task Queue that a handler Worker is polling.
Nexus Services and [Nexus Operations](/nexus/services-operations#nexus-operations) are often registered in the same Worker as the underlying Temporal primitives they abstract.

The [Nexus Registry](/nexus/registry-endpoints#nexus-registry) is used to create and manage Nexus Endpoints.

:::info

In Temporal Cloud, the Nexus Registry is scoped to an Account and cross cloud calls are not available yet.

In self-hosted deployments, the Nexus Registry is scoped to a Cluster and only single cluster deployments are supported.

## Familiar programming model

Nexus has a familiar programming model that supports both sync and async patterns.
It is suitable for low-latency and long-running Operations. 
[Asynchronous Nexus Operations](/nexus/services-operations#operation-lifecycle) have an Operation identity that is used to automatically re-attach a caller Workflow in the event of a process failure.
Nexus also provides a uniform interface to get the status of an Operation or its result, receive a completion callback, or cancel the Operation – all of which are fully integrated into the Temporal platform.

## Preserves benefits of EDA at runtime

Nexus uses the Temporal queue-based Worker architecture to provide the benefits of an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) at runtime.
If a Nexus Service is down, a caller Workflow can continue to schedule Nexus Operations and the Nexus Machinery will take on the responsibility of at-least-once execution by retrying the Operation on the caller's behalf.

## Built-in Nexus Machinery

The built-in Nexus Machinery uses state-machine-based invocation and [Nexus RPC](/glossary#nexus-rpc), a new protocol designed with durable execution in mind.
Nexus RPC supports arbitrary-duration Operations that extend beyond a traditional RPC — a key underpinning to connect durable executions within and across Namespaces, clusters, and regions.

For example, when you execute a Nexus Operation in a caller Workflow, a command is sent to Temporal to schedule the Operation, and the Nexus Machinery is responsible for making the Nexus RPC calls on your behalf.
This means you don’t have to use Nexus RPC directly, only the Temporal SDK along with the Temporal Service.
