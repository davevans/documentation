:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is available in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

## Connect Temporal Applications

[Temporal Nexus](/evaluate/nexus) is a feature of the Temporal Platform designed to connect Temporal Applications across team, Namespace, region, and cloud boundaries.
It promotes a more modular architecture for sharing a subset of your team’s capabilities with well-defined microservice contracts for other teams to use, that abstract underlying Temporal primitives, like Workflows, or execute arbitrary code.

Nexus provides an integrated Temporal SDK experience, built-in Nexus Machinery, and first-class observability. It enables each team to have their own Namespace for improved security, troubleshooting, and blast radius isolation.

:::info

Cross-cloud Nexus connectivity is not yet supported in Temporal Cloud.

:::

## Integrated Temporal experience

[Nexus Services](/nexus/services) are exposed from [Nexus Endpoints](/nexus/endpoints) that are created in the [Nexus Registry](/nexus/registry).
A [Nexus Endpoint](/nexus/endpoints) is a reverse proxy that can serve multiple [Nexus Services](/nexus/services).
It decouples the caller from the handler and routes Nexus requests to an upstream target Namespace and Task Queue that a handler Worker is polling.
Nexus Services and [Nexus Operations](/nexus/operations) are often registered in the same Worker as the underlying Temporal primitives they abstract.

The [Nexus Registry](/nexus/registry) is used to create and manage Nexus Endpoints.

:::info

The Nexus Registry is scoped to an Account in Temporal Cloud and scoped to a Cluster for self-hosted deployments.

## Familiar programming model

Nexus is supported in Temporal SDKs that provide a familiar programming model and supports both synchronous and asynchronous patterns.
It is suitable for low-latency and long-running Operations. 
[Asynchronous Nexus Operations](/nexus/operations#operation-lifecycle) have an Operation identity that is used to automatically re-attach a caller Workflow in the event of a process failure.
Nexus also provides a uniform interface to get the status of an Operation or its result, receive a completion callback, or cancel the Operation – all of which are fully integrated into the Temporal platform.

## Preserves benefits of EDA at runtime

Nexus uses the Temporal queue-based Worker architecture to provide the benefits of an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) at runtime.
If a Nexus Service is down, a caller Workflow can continue to schedule Nexus Operations and the Nexus Machinery guarantees at-least-once execution.
The Nexus Machinery uses state-machined-based invocation and completion callbacks; and will retry the Operation on the caller Workflow's behalf.

## Queue-based Worker architecture

Nexus uses the Temporal queue-based Worker architecture to ensure reliable execution and automatic load balancing for Nexus Operations.
When a caller Workflow schedules a Nexus Operation, Temporal atomically transfers the Nexus request to a Nexus state machine responsible for [at-least-once](/nexus/operations#execution-semantics) invocation of the Nexus Operation.

Workers authenticate to thier Namespace with supported methods including mTLS client certificates or API Keys in Temporal Cloud.
This establishes the caller's identity and caller namespace for Endpoint access control.
Nexus handler Workers poll the Endpoint's target Task Queue for Nexus Tasks to process.

Nexus connectivity across Namespaces is provided by the Temporal Platform. 
Temporal Cloud connects all Namespaces within an Account and provides built-in Endpoint access controls.
Self-hosted deployments support Nexus connectivity within a single Cluster and you can implement a custom Authorizer.

![NexusYourCloud](/img/nexus/nexus-workers.png)

When you execute a [Nexus Operation](/nexus/operations) in a caller Workflow, the caller and handler Workers interact with Temporal as follows:

1. **RespondWorkflowTaskCompleted([ScheduleNexusOperation command](/references/commands#schedulenexusoperation))** \-
is used by the caller Worker to schedule a Nexus Operation, which atomically hands off execution to the caller's Nexus Machinery.
2. **PollNexusTaskQueue** \-
is used by the handler Worker to recieve a [Nexus Task](/workers#nexus-task) to process, for example to start a Nexus Operation.
3. **RespondNexusTaskCompleted** or **RespondNexusTaskFailed** \-
is used by the handler Worker to return the Nexus Task result.
[Asynchronous Nexus Operations](/nexus/operations) will return a Nexus Operation ID, that can be used to perform additional actions like canceling an Operation.
[Synchronous Nexus Operations](/nexus/operations#synchronous-operation-lifecycle) will return the Operation result directly.
The caller's Nexus Machinery recieves the result and records a [NexusOperation event](/references/events#nexusoperationstarted) in the caller's Workflow History.
4. **PollWorkflowTaskQueue** \-
is used by the caller Worker to recieve a Workflow Task with the [Nexus Operation event](/references/events#nexusoperationstarted) which may be Started, Completed, Failed, Canceled, or TimedOut.

## Built-in Nexus Machinery

The built-in [Nexus Machinery](/glossary#nexus-machinery) uses state-machine-based invocation and completion callbacks to guarantee at-least-once execution of Nexus Operations.
It uses [Nexus RPC](/glossary#nexus-rpc) on the wire, a new protocol designed with Durable Execution in mind, to communicate across Namespaces within an Account.

Nexus RPC supports arbitrary-duration Operations that extend beyond a traditional RPC — a key underpinning to connect durable executions within and across Namespaces, clusters, and regions.

For example, when you execute a Nexus Operation in a caller Workflow, a command is sent to Temporal to schedule the Operation, and the Nexus Machinery is responsible for making the Nexus RPC calls on your behalf.
This means you don’t have to use Nexus RPC directly, only the Temporal SDK along with the Temporal Service.

## Multi-level calls
Nexus supports multi-level Nexus calls, for example:
- Workflow A → Nexus Operation 1 → Workflow B → Nexus Operation 2 → Workflow C
