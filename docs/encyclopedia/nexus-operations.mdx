:::tip SUPPORT, STABILITY, and DEPENDENCY INFO

Temporal Nexus is available in [Public Preview](/evaluate/development-production-features/release-stages#public-preview) for [Temporal Cloud](/cloud/nexus) and [self-hosted deployments](/production-deployment/self-hosted-guide/nexus).

## Arbitrary-duration operations

[Nexus Operations](/glossary#nexus-operation) are arbitrary-duration operations that may be synchronous or asynchronous, short-lived or long-lived, and are used to connect Temporal Applications within and across Namespaces, clusters, regions, and clouds.

Unlike a traditional RPC, an asynchronous Nexus Operation has an operation identity that can be used to re-attach to a long-lived Nexus Operation, for example, one backed by a Temporal Workflow.
Nexus Operations support a uniform interface to get the status of an operation or its result, receive a completion callback, or cancel the operation – all of which are fully integrated into the Temporal Platform.

## SDK support

The Temporal SDK provides an integrated Temporal experience to build, run, and use Nexus Operations.

:::tip RESOURCES
- [Go SDK - Nexus quick start and code sample](/develop/go/nexus)
- [Java SDK - Nexus quick start and code sample](/develop/java/nexus)
:::

Caller Workflows use the Temporal SDK to execute Nexus Operations.

Nexus Operation handlers are created with Temporal SDK builder functions such as:

- New-Workflow-Run-Operation
  - Start a Workflow as an asynchronous Operation.
- New-Sync-Operation
  - Invoke an underlying Query or Signal as a synchronous Operation.
  - Invoke an Update as a synchronous Operation.
  - Execute arbitrary code as a synchronous Operation.

Nexus Operations are not intrinsically durable, but can be made durable by backing them with Temporal primitives like a Workflow, Update, or Signal.
Operations may be implemented with Temporal primitives or execute arbitrary code, for example to make a database query or call a microservice.

## Nexus Operation Lifecycle {#operation-lifecycle}

When you execute a Nexus Operation from a caller Workflow using the Temporal SDK, a command is sent to Temporal to schedule the Nexus Operation which is atomically handed off to the Nexus Machinery.
The [Nexus Machinery](/glossary#nexus-machinery) uses state-machine-based invocation and completion callbacks to ensure [at-least-once](#at-least-once-execution-semantics-and-idempotency) execution of a Nexus Operation and reliable delivery of the result.

![Nexus Overview](/img/nexus-overview.png)

The Nexus Machinery is responsible for making the Nexus RPC calls on behalf of the caller Workflow, with [automatic-retries](#automatic-retries).
This means you don’t have to use Nexus RPC directly, only the Temporal SDK along with the Temporal Service.

### System interactions

Nexus Operations are often registered in the same Worker as the underlying Temporal primitives they abstract.

![NexusYourCloud](/img/nexus/nexus-connect-queue-based-workers.png)

For example, when you execute a Nexus Operation in a caller Workflow:
1. **RespondWorkflowTaskCompleted([ScheduleNexusOperation command](/references/commands#schedulenexusoperation))** \-
is used by the caller Worker to schedule a Nexus Operation, which atomically hands off execution to the caller's Nexus Machinery.
2. **PollNexusTaskQueue** \-
is used by the handler Worker to recieve a [Nexus Task](/workers#nexus-task) to process, for example to start a Nexus Operation.
3. **RespondNexusTaskCompleted** or **RespondNexusTaskFailed** \-
is used by the handler Worker to return the Nexus Task result.
When asked to start a Nexus Operation, the Nexus handler decides if the Operation will be synchronous or asynchronous.
   1. This is typically a static decision based on the [Temporal SDK builder function used](#sdk-support).
   2. [Asynchronous Nexus Operations](#asynchronous-operation-lifecycle), created with the New-Workflow-Run-Operation SDK helper, will return a Nexus Operation ID, that can be used to perform additional actions like canceling an Operation.
   3. [Synchronous Nexus Operations](#synchronous-operation-lifecycle), created with the New-Sync-Operation SDK helper, will return the Operation result directly.
The caller's Nexus Machinery recieves the result and records a [NexusOperation event](/references/events#nexusoperationstarted) in the caller's Workflow History.
4. **PollWorkflowTaskQueue** \-
is used by the caller Worker to recieve a Workflow Task with the [Nexus Operation event](/references/events#nexusoperationstarted) which may be Started, Completed, Failed, Canceled, or TimedOut.

### Asynchronous Operation lifecycle {#asynchronous-operation-lifecycle}

An asynchronous Nexus Operation may take up to 60 days to complete in Temporal Cloud, to allow for callback URL token validation with asymmetric key rotation at those intervals.

The lifecycle of an asynchronous Nexus Operation:

1. Caller’s Workflow executes a Nexus Operation using the Temporal SDK.
   1. `NexusOperationScheduled` is added to caller’s Event History.
   2. Nexus Operation added to Nexus Machinery in the caller’s Temporal cluster.
   3. Caller Workflow doesn’t automatically block on a Nexus Operation.
   4. Caller’s Workflow can interact with the Nexus Operation execution:
      1. Wait for the Nexus Operation to start.
      2. Wait for the Operation result.
      3. Cancel the Nexus Operation.
2. The caller’s Temporal Service attempts to start the Nexus Operation on the target cluster through the Nexus Endpoint.
   1. Nexus Machinery in the target cluster sync matches the Nexus request to a Worker polling the endpoint's target Namespace and Task Queue.
   2. Retries are processed by the Nexus Machinery in the caller’s Temporal cluster and tracked as part of the caller Workflow, similar to Activities.
3. Nexus Operation handler processes the Nexus Operation.
   1. Handler Worker gets a Nexus Task from Task Queue.
   2. Operation handler starts a Workflow in the target cluster with attached Nexus Callback.
   3. Nexus Operation ID is returned since the Nexus Operation is asynchronous.
   4. `NexusOperationStarted` is added to caller’s Event History.
   5. Operation ID is associated with the caller's `NexusOperationStarted` event and the caller Workflow is unblocked if waiting for `NexusOperationStarted` using the Temporal SDK.
4. Handler’s Nexus Machinery sends a Nexus completion Callback when the Workflow reaches a terminal state.
   1. Operation result is returned via callback since the operation is asynchronous.
   2. `NexusOperationCompleted` is added to caller’s Event History.
5. Caller’s Workflow code is returned the result if requested.

### Synchronous Operation lifecycle

A synchronous Nexus Operation handler has less than 10 seconds to complete, as measured from the caller's Nexus Machinery, and will then timeout with a retryable error.
The handler should stay within the context deadline to not timeout.
The Nexus Operation will be retried by the caller's Nexus Machinery, until the operation's Schedule-to-Close timeout has been exceeded.

The lifecycle of a synchronous Nexus Operation, for example to do a Query or a Signal:

1. Caller’s Workflow executes a Nexus Operation using the Temporal SDK.
   1. **`NexusOperationScheduled`** added to caller’s Event History.
   2. Nexus Operation added to Nexus Machinery in the caller’s Temporal cluster.
   3. Caller Workflow doesn’t automatically block on a Nexus Operation.
   4. Caller’s Workflow can interact with the Nexus Operation execution:
      1. Wait for the Nexus Operation to start (not needed for synchronous operations).
      2. Wait for the Operation result.
      3. Cancel the Nexus Operation (not allowed for synchronous operations).
2. The caller’s Temporal cluster attempts to start the Nexus Operation on the target cluster via the Nexus Endpoint.
   1. Nexus Machinery in the target cluster sync matches the Nexus request to a Worker polling the endpoint's target Namespace and Task Queue.
   2. Retries are processed by the Nexus Machinery in the caller’s Temporal cluster and tracked as part of the caller Workflow, similar to Activities.
3. Nexus Operation handler processes the Nexus Operation.
   1. Handler Worker gets a Nexus Task from Task Queue.
   2. Operation handler is executed, which may use the Temporal client to Signal or Query a workflow.
   3. Operation result is returned inline, since the operation is synchronous.
   4. **`NexusOperationCompleted`** added to caller’s Event History.
4. Caller’s Workflow code is returned the result if requested.

### Executing arbitrary code from a synchronous Nexus Operation handler {#executing-arbitrary-code-from-a-sync-handler}

Synchronous Nexus Operation handlers can execute arbitrary code, but unlike Activities they should be short-lived.
As mentioned above, a synchronous Nexus Operation handler has less than 10 seconds to process a Nexus start operation request and should stay within the context deadline provided by the Temporal SDK.

## Automatic Retries {#automatic-retries}

Once the caller Workflow schedules an Operation with the caller’s Temporal cluster, the caller’s Nexus Machinery keeps trying to start the Operation, with automatic retries and exponential backoff.
If a Nexus Operation returns a [retryable error](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/13d6cd8cf7a4ba0c4660cf98f672bbd645dca3e7/components/nexusoperations/executors.go#L659) when attempting to start, the Operation it will be retried up to the [default Retry Policy’s](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal/blob/de7c8879e103be666a7b067cc1b247f0ac63c25c/components/nexusoperations/config.go#L111) max attempts and expiration interval.

## Execution semantics {#execution-semantics}

### At-least-once execution semantics and idempotency

Since the caller's Nexus Machinery will keep trying to start the Operation multiple times, the Nexus Operation handler should be idempotent, like Activities should be idempotent.
It's not required in all cases, but highly recommended in general.
With retries an Operation, like Activities, has at-least-once execution semantics, so an Operation should be idempotent as a general rule.

### Exactly-once execution semantics through an underlying WorkflowIDReusePolicy

To deduplicate work and get exactly-once execution semantics, an Operation can start a Workflow with a WorkflowIDReusePolicy of RejectDuplicates which only allows one Workflow Execution per Workflow ID within a Namespace for the Retention Period.

## Cancelation

## Termination

## Versioning {#versioning}

Task Routing is the simplest way to version your service code.

If you have a new backward-incompatible Nexus Operation Handler, for example due to a wire-level incompatible breaking change, start by using a different Service and Task Queue.
The version may be part of the service name, for example `prod.payments.v2`.
Callers can then migrate to the new version in their normal deployment schedule.
