## Nexus Endpoints {#nexus-endpoints}

A Nexus Endpoint is a reverse proxy that can route Nexus requests from a caller Workflow to an upstream target Namespace and Task Queue that a Worker is polling.
An Endpoint decouples the caller and handler, so the caller only needs to know the Endpoint name. The Endpoint encapsulates the upstream target Namespace and Task Queue from the caller.
A Worker handles Nexus requests by registering one or more [Nexus Services](/nexus/services-operations) and polling the Endpoint's target Task Queue.

Multiple Nexus Endpoints can target the same target Namespace.
For example, to decompose a monolithic Namespace into multiple Nexus Endpoints you can add multiple Nexus Endpoints that target the monolithic Namespace, and then update the Endpoints to target different target Namespaces later.

Adding a Nexus Endpoint to the Nexus Registry deploys the Endpoint, so it is available at runtime to serve Nexus requests.

## Nexus Registry {#nexus-registry}

The Nexus Registry is used to create and manage Nexus Endpoints.
In self-hosted deployments, the registry is scoped to a Cluster; while in Temporal Cloud, it is scoped to an Account.
Developers can advertise available Endpoints and Services, so others can find them for use in their caller Workflows.

Endpoint names must be unique within the Nexus Registry.

You can search the Nexus Registry for Endpoint name or an Endpoint's target Namespace to quickly find an Endpoint of interest.
The Endpoint details page shows the target Namespace and target Task Queue along with the endpoint description rendered as markdown.

Creating a Nexus Endpoint includes setting an Access Policy of caller Namespaces that can access the Endpoint.
Even the target Namespace must be added to the Access Policy to access the Endpoint.
Temporal Cloud also provides built-in Endpoint access control in the form of a caller Namespace allowlist, which must be set for any caller to access a Nexus Endpoint, even if in the same Namespace.

Editing a Nexus Endpoint allows changing everything but the Endpoint Name.
The target Namespace and target Task Queue can be updated without interrupting existing in-flight Nexus Operations that are already being processed, and new Nexus Operations will be routed to the updated target Namespace and target Task Queue.

The Access Policy may also be edited to add or remove caller Namespaces that can access the Endpoint.
