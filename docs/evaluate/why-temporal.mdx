# Why Temporal?
Modern applications are increasingly distributed. 
If your architecture spans multiple services or databases, ensuring reliability, scaling efficiently, and maintaining visibility becomes a fundamental challenge.

Failures are inevitable and managing them effectively is critical to maintaining system durability. 
Traditional approaches rely on retries, queues, and ad-hoc state tracking - leading to brittle workarounds, complexity, and operational burden. 
Temporal provides a structured way to build resilient applications by ensuring execution continues, even in the face of failures.

Developers building distributed applications often encounter three core challenges which Temporal addresses these through three fundamental shifts:

- Reliability, built in → Applications execute to completion, no matter how long they run or how many failures occur. 
Temporal ensures fault-tolerance at scale by managing retries and state without additional complexity.
- Code-first development → Instead of managing fragile state machines or configuration-heavy workflows, developers write application logic in code using their existing tech stacks.
- Execution visibility → Every application's state, progress, and history are accessible in real time, making it easier to monitor, debug, and maintain applications. Debugging is no longer guesswork - developers see exactly what happened and why.

## Reliable execution

**How does Temporal make applications reliable?**

Temporal makes it easier for developers to build and operate reliable, scalable applications without sacrificing productivity.
The design of the system ensures that, once started, an application's main function executes to completion, whether that takes minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even years.
Temporal calls this _Durable Execution._

## Code structure

**How does Temporal simplify application code for software developers?**

By shifting the burden of failure handling from the application to the platform, there is less code for application developers to write, test, and maintain.
Temporal's programming model offers developers a way to express their business logic into coherent _Workflows_ that are much easier to develop than distributed code bases.

Choose the SDK that best suits your preferred programming language and start writing your business logic.
Integrate your favorite IDE, libraries, and tools into your development process.
Temporal also supports polyglot and idiomatic programming - which enables developers to leverage the strengths of various programming languages and integrate Temporal into existing codebases.
Developers achieve all of this without having to manage queues or complex state machines.

## State visibility

**How does Temporal make it easier to view the state of the application?**

Temporal provides out-of-the-box tooling that enables developers to see the state of their applications whenever they need to.
The Temporal CLI allows developers to manage, monitor, and debug Temporal applications effectively.
The browser-based Web UI lets you to quickly isolate, debug, and resolve production problems.
