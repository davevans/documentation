# Why Temporal?
Modern applications are increasingly distributed - spanning multiple services, databases, and providers. 
But with that comes complexity:
- How do you ensure execution doesnâ€™t break in production when services fail?
- How do you manage retries, timeouts, and failures without writing thousands of lines of error-handling code?
- How do you track what actually happened in an application when debugging an issue?

Developers often manually patch together solutions using queues, retries, external databases, and homegrown orchestration tools. 
But these approaches are difficult to scale as applications grow, introduce hidden failures, and make debugging unpredictable challenging - leading to custom tracing solutions, brittle workarounds, and operational burden.

Engineering teams commonly find themselves spending significant time implementing and maintaining reliability patterns rather than focusing on core business logic. 
This trade-off becomes more pronounced as systems scale and reliability requirements increase. 
As systems scale, this burden only grows, having developers to build custom tools just to keep things running.

Temporal provides a structured way to build resilient applications by ensuring execution continues, even in the face of failures.

## Reliable execution

**How does Temporal make applications reliable?**

Temporal makes it easier for developers to build and operate reliable, scalable applications without sacrificing productivity.
The design of the system ensures that, once started, an application's main function executes to completion, whether that takes minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even years.
Temporal calls this _Durable Execution._ Failures are inevitable and managing them effectively is critical to maintaining system durability. 

## Code structure

**How does Temporal simplify application code for software developers?**

By shifting the burden of failure handling from the application to the platform, there is less code for application developers to write, test, and maintain.
Instead of managing fragile state machines or configuration-heavy workflows, developers write application logic in code using their existing tech stacks.

With code-first development, choose the SDK that best suits your preferred programming language and start writing your business logic.
Integrate your favorite IDE, libraries, and tools into your development process.
Temporal also supports polyglot and idiomatic programming - which enables developers to leverage the strengths of various programming languages and integrate Temporal into existing codebases.

## State visibility

**How does Temporal make it easier to view the state of the application?**
Temporal provides out-of-the-box tooling that enables developers to see the state of their applications whenever they need to.
Every application's state, progress, and history are accessible in real time, making it easier to monitor, debug, and maintain applications. 
Debugging is no longer guesswork - developers see exactly what happened and why.

The Temporal CLI allows developers to manage, monitor, and debug Temporal applications effectively.
The browser-based Web UI lets you to quickly isolate, debug, and resolve production problems.
